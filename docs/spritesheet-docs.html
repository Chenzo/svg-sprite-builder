SVG to SpriteSheet
===================


This gulp project takes a folder of individual SVGs and produces a single `spritesheet.svg` file, a single `spritesheet.css` file, individual standalone fallback *.pngs* for older browsers, and `svg-sprites.html` example file.

It also contains a simple express.js server to serve the svg-sprites.html for easy copy/paste after the sprites have been produced.

The purpose of this is to have a very simple process to take Adobe Illustrator vector graphics, save them as .svgs and then have gulp convert them into a single file that is cacheable and can be rerun when new sprites are required.

----------


Installation
-------------

> **Note:** node.js is required to be installed for all this to work.

Copy all the files in the project to your local drive. Navigate to the svg-sprite-builder folder in terminal and type:

```
$ npm install
```

This will download all the nessessary node modules. After this command has run your directory structure should look like this:

```
svn-sprite-builder/
├── Gulpfile.js
├── docs/
├── node_modules/
├── README.md
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── pngs/
│   ├── scss/

├── server.js
└── src/
    ├── htmltemplate/
    │   └── svg-sprites.html
    ├── js/
    │   └── svg4everybody.min.js
    └── svgs/
```


Usage
-------------

### Quickstart

Put svgs into `/src/svgs` folder, run default gulp command:
```
$ gulp
```
 
Files are output to the `dist` folder. Look at the `svg-sprite.html` file for usage.

### Adobe Illustrator svg output

Have your each of your vector sprites be in their own file. Make sure the artboard is as small as possible. In Illustrator's menu select **Object > Artboards > Fit to Artwork Bounds**

![Fit Artwork](/docs/illustrator-clip.jpg)

> **Note:** The Artboard is the viewBox and width and height of the resulting sprite. It does not need to be tight around the sprite if you want a margin/padding in the sprite itself.

Save the file as SVG format in the `/src/svgs` folder with these settings:

![Illustrator Output Settings](/docs/illustrator-settings.jpg)

### Create Sprites

To combine the svgs and output the spritesheet, in the `svn-sprite-builder` directory, run the default gulp command:

```
$ gulp
```

> **Note:** the sprites' id/name is same as the SVG's filename. 

This command outputs the following:

- **/dist/css/spritesheet.css** - a standalone .css file with all the SVGs added inline
- **/dist/scss/_spritesheet.scss** - a SASS file with all the SVGs added as mixins
-  **/dist/scss/_spritesheet_vars.scss** - a SASS file with variables of the SVG data for the background source in the `_spritesheet.scss` file.
- **/dist/svg/spritesheet.svg** - a standlone .svg file containing all the SVGs merged. All symbols are flagged with the original SVGs name
- **/dist/pngs/[SVG NAME].png** - individual PNGs for use with fall-back scripts and styles for older browsers
- **/dist/js/svg4everybody.min.js** - polyfill for SVGs in older browsers - https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody
- **/dist/svg-sprites.html** - an example file containing code snippets of all compiled sprites.

### Express Server Examples

Included with this project is a simple ExpressJS server to allow for quick and easy testing while building out the spritesheet. While in the `svn-sprite-builder` directory run the following command to launch the server

```
$ node server.js
```
Once the server is running, point your browser to http://localhost:7080 and you'll see the svg-sprites.html page up and running with the code snippets you'll need to use them.

Local documentation can be reached via http://localhost:7080/docs/ when the node expressJS server is running

### How to use

####.css spritesheet: *(recommended method)*
To use the CSS spritesheet, copy and include the spritesheet.css file on your page.
``` 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/spritesheet.css"/>
```
to use a sprite, include an element with a class with the svgsptbg_SVGNAME for instance:
```
<div class="svgsptbg_circle">circle</div>
```
####SASS spritesheet: 
To use the SASS spritesheet you need to move the SASS files over to your project and include them:
```scss
@import "partials/reset";
@import "partials/base";
```
The sprites are created as mixins for ease of use. They're named following this pattern `sprite_[SVG NAME]` Use the following to apply the SVG to your HTML elements:

```scss
.square {
    @include sprite_square
}

/*or*/

.square {
    &:before {
        @include sprite_square
    }
}
```

####.svg spritesheet
To use the CSS spritesheet, copy the spritesheet.svg file to your site, and then include the following code:
```html
<svg class="svgsprite_circle">
    <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="svg/spritesheet.svg#circle"></use>
</svg>
```
you will also need the style to define it's size (which is auto generated an inside the` svg-sprites.html` file:)

```css
<style>
    .svgsprite_circle {
        width: 40px;
        height: 40px;
    } 
</style>
```

Additional Gulp Commands
-------------
To only out the SASS files, use the following command:
```
$ gulp sass
```
